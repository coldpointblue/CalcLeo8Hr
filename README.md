## Features

- User-friendly UI with Rotation
- Dynamic UI with Button On/Off Switches
- High-Precision Calculations
- Basic Arithmetic Operations
- High-performance Algorithms
- Automated Tests for Developers

---

## Requirements

- iOS 15.6+
- macOS Sonoma 14.0+
- Swift 5.9+

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/coldpointblue/CalcLeo8Hr.git
    ```
  
2. Navigate to the project folder and open `CalcLeo8Hr.xcodeproj` with Xcode.

3. Build and run the application on your Mac.

---

## Usage

- To perform basic arithmetic, simply tap the numerical keys and arithmetic operation keys.
- To change the UI press and hold the display area then modify the overlay's button on/off switches.
- Rotate the screen to your liking.
---

## Testing

### Unit Testing

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Navigate to the Test Navigator.
3. Run all unit tests.

### UI Testing

1. UI tests are written using XCTest.
2. They can be run via the Xcode Test Navigator.

> Unit tests will cover both normal and edge cases but are now only an example. The intent is to test basic arithmetic operations and also exceptional scenarios like dividing by zero.

---

## Performance Optimizations

- Mathematical algorithms are optimized for primary use-cases and precision.
- Memory-efficient data structures like tuples are used.
- Early exits are employed for efficiency and speed.
- Modular code is readable and modifyable.

---

## Future Direction

- Add safe networking call's infrastructure.
- Add UI to adjust calculation precision.
